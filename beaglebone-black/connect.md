**Platform** : Ubuntu 14.04

1. Connect the USB cable to the computer.
    The power LED on Beaglebone must light up and 3 LEDs for heartbeat, flash use and CPU use must start blinking. After a while, the Linux must detect a new network connection.

2. SSH into the beaglebone:

    ```bash
    ssh root@192.168.7.2
    ```
    There is no password by default. For all our private usage, we will not require it. The user must now be in the beaglebone prompt.
